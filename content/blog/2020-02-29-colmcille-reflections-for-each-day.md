Who was Colmcille?

From the beginning he had a lot going for him. He was the son of a noble family, a direct descendent of the great High King, Niall of the Nine Hostages. His people were princes and kings in their world. You could say he was born to be a leader. And lead he did. He did not hide his light under a bushel. He was eloquent and spoke the truth with power and was equally at home with kings and beggars. He did not fear conflict or shrink before opposition. He was bold and daring and lived his life the full.



Who am I? What life have I been given to live? What gifts? What possibilities? At this point of my life, what now?



Colmcille was a _Legend_!

When somebody is truly extraordinary young people say: ‘Legend!’ A hundred years after his death, when St Eunan wrote about him, Colmcille was indeed a ‘Legend’. For Eunan and all those who cherished his memory the only thing that mattered was that he had been a man of God. “He was an angel in demeanour, blameless in what he said, godly in what he did, brilliant in intellect and great in counsel.” Old people who remembered him from their youth said he was so close to God that he could work miracles, very like the miracles of Jesus. He calmed storms, cured sick people, even raised the dead(?). He had prophetic knowledge; he knew about things that were happening hundreds of miles away; he could read others people’s souls. He communed with Angels; some people said they saw him in prayer surrounded by angelic light.



Colmcille’s communion with God was ‘legendary’ and life-changing. It changed his life and the lives of the people around him and others who came after him. What does communion with God, perhaps a good deal less legendary, mean for me? How could it change my life?
