Welcome

We are a group of Donegal based people invited to work under the auspices of the Raphoe Diocese of the Catholic Church in partnership with the Raphoe Diocese of the Church of Ireland in order to prepare for the commemorations of the 1500th anniversary of the death of St Colmcille which will occur in 2020-2021. 

We have undertaken to explore the life and legacy of St Colmcille, and to consider how he speaks to us today. With partners in the public and private sectors we plan to develop a Turas Cholmcille, a network of connected sites relating to the saint, to honour his legacy and establish a meaningful way for people to engage with St Colmcille in organised or personal pilgrimage. 

We are teachers, business-people, musicians, writers, historians, clergymen and women. Along the way we have met with Colmcille experts, historian Christy Gillespie, archaeologist Dr Brian Lacey, and those who have maintained sites and traditions related to St Colmcille in parishes around the Raphoe diocese and the neighbouring diocese as we begin to mark our formal commemoration of Colmcille. 

We invite your support, and we welcome your interest. Follow our progress here, check in to learn of St Colmcille, of the rich Columban heritage, for news and opportunities to connect with our project.
