Colmcille

And did you sing Columba, when you prayed?

And in the song that filled your heart what was there of home?

Did a thrush thrill fill you, bee song?

I wonder if the winds carried Gartan to you, 

across the seas, the kingdoms; 

curlew and moorhen and the corncrake’s racket.

This time of year, when lamb bleat breaks out 

and there are foxes

did you hear battle cries rising all night, 

nights when you didn’t sleep, infusing your prayer?

And what is it to pray all night? To have visions, an angel of God appear?

I am called to pray in your shadow, in your memory and honour 

and I am glad, who has walked away time and again 

to have this holy hand reach to me. 

I heard you when I’d forgotten I was listening.

Soldier. Sinner. I am all these and proud, Columba I think you were proud

Gael, Uí Néill, Connallach.

Sing with me, pray with me Columba.
