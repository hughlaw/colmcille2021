  I wrote this after our trip to Dunlewey and Cnoc na Naomh last year, I finally
  resolved a wee kink in it last week. I think the timing is right.

It rains heavy, the day we drive to Dunlewey to meet the Archaeologist.

I kick my shoes off before going inside, drop my backpack on the floor.

He pulls books down, quotes in Latin and Irish, recalls page numbers.



Heâ€™d thrown a seed bomb into a drought a few weeks ago

laughing, says, *Sure I was confident of rain in Donegal.*

Plenty of rain today, it hurls itself in rolls off Errigal.



He makes us tea, tells us stories, we are questions, note taking.

I could stay here all day, listening to the rain

thinking of maps, history, man, myth, of crosses made and gifted.



We leave though, drive satnav aided to the top of Cnoc na Naomh

say the Stations of the Cross on the way up, because someone built them here, 

where Colmcille, Fionan, Dubthach and Begley 



threw down croziers and staked their claims.

I hear them new, each station - *Jesus falls for the first time*

*Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry his cross*. I gaze at Tory



Colmcille never threw a crozier anywhere near it, I am certain.

But beautifully, for a moment there is trust, an Easter renewal

and I grasp, what has been generously, naturally, held out for me.
